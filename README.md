Project Overview — PSMMS-AI

PSMMS-AI (Product Sales Management System with AI) is a desktop application developed to help small businesses, retail shops, and stores efficiently manage their products, customers, and sales. It combines a user-friendly interface with a powerful MySQL database for secure data storage. The system also includes an AI assistant powered by a local machine-learning model using Ollama, which allows users to receive sales insights and interact with AI—completely offline.

This project was built using Python’s Tkinter for the graphical interface, MySQL for data handling, and Matplotlib for visual charts. The system provides complete CRUD operations, automated revenue calculations, and real-time business analytics to support decision-making. It is designed as a professional portfolio and academic project demonstrating modern software development concepts, including database integration, GUI programming, data visualization, and lightweight AI integration.
